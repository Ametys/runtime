/**
 * This class is a message of the bus. It is determined by its type, and the associated targets.
 * The following example explains that the selection has changed for the search tool.
 * 
 * 		Ext.create("Ametys.message.Message", {
 * 			type: Ametys.message.Message.SELECTION_CHANGED,
 * 
 *			targets: {
 *				type: Ametys.message.MessageTarget.TOOL,
 *				parameters: { ids: ['search-tool'] }
 *			}
 * 		});
 * 
 * Beware that the message creation is asynchronous and the message is automatically fired as soon as ready.
 * You can be aware of the fire event using a #cfg-callback
 * You can prepare targets to share them in several messages using Ametys.message.MessageTargetFactory#createTargets
 * 
 * To specify the type you should use constants defined in this class.
 * Each constant documentation defines potential associated parameters and targets specification.
 * 
 * All external contribution should define their constants in this class.
 * 
 * Beware: #SELECTION_CHANGED is a special event. Read its documentation carefully.

			 * The target and subtarget is the new element selected and can be of any type.
			 * This event is special on two ways:
			 *    * first, it is listened by the Ametys.message.MessageBus itself to feed its method Ametys.message.MessageBus#getCurrentSelectionMessage
			 *    * second, selection changed messages are concurrent and volatile: so, when you create such an event with an asynchronous target, it may be never thrown if some other code do create and throw another selection message in between.
			 * Please note, that when you send such a message, a #SELECTION_CHANGING is thrown before.
			 * Parameters are:
			 * @property {String} SELECTION_CHANGED.creation If the selection was just consecutive to a creation of the object, you can specify here the type of target because the ribbon tab policy is different for object created and selected in a row: it will force tab selection. So be careful, when creating and selecting an object in a row, you must first fire the #CREATED event.
